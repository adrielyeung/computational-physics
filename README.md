# computational-physics
(Project for Computational Physics course in autumn 2017)

An exploration of 5 basic concepts of Computational Physics: (1) precision of floating point variables, (2) LU decomposition to solve coupled equations, (3) interpolation (linear, cubic splines), (4) Fourier transforms, and (5) random number generation.

Program written in Python 3. The number at the end of each ```.py``` file name indicates the subsection it is related to. The ```Test``` files were used to verify results shown in the report.
